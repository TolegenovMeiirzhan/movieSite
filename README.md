Structure of App

  There are basic models like: movies, reviews, categories, ratings, actors and directors.
 Movies are added to the admin panel, each movie has its own ip, rating, actors, categories and genres.
 Users can leave reviews with their posts and names or can respond to a review. And everyone can find 
 a movie by category (cartoons, TV series or movies), genre, year of release or rating. And each actor 
 has its own page with detailed information. And on every page of the movie you can watch the trailer and put a rating.
